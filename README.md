In this assignment we have to create a working snake game and then chang it somehow.
The change must preserve the following attributes:
	Snake moves with keyboard inputs
	list of links for the snake
	food placed randomly for snake to eat
	detect when snake eats food and grows
	detect when snake eats itself or hits a wall -> game over
	score
	creativity
